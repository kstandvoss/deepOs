# Correlations of Network Layers

Dependencies: Keras + Theano

To create correlations for two a non-convolutional networks run *calc_correlations.py*. For convolutional network pass *cnn* as an argument. Note that reading activations only works with theano. You may need to create a models and results folder. Load a result with the *load_result* fucntion from *experiemt.py*.
